# AU2019

## Class introduction

Railway projects have a lot of regulations, diverse technical fields, and project members coming from many different backgrounds. These factors and many more all come together during the design process and need to be managed to make the project a success. This class will show how connecting and using design data in Civil 3D software, AutoCAD software, and Dynamo can help us meet this challenge. Attendees will see examples of how to make regulations interactive and more easily accessible, and how to transform design data depending on the required technical field or output. We will also demonstrate tools to assist the designers so they can better analyze their creations, and in doing so, motivate them to start interacting and designing in a new way.

## Data

In the [data](https://github.com/TUCRAIL/AU2019/tree/master/data) folder you will find the drawings and dynamo scripts used in the presentation. Feel free to adjust and play with them as you like. All videos used in the presentation are also available in this folder.

## Installation

Visual Studio 2019 was used to create this solution.  
The [source code](https://github.com/TUCRAIL/AU2019/tree/master/src) can be cloned to your computer for building and testing.
  
## Packages
When building the solution the dll's are copied to the packages in the [Dynamo_Packages](https://github.com/TUCRAIL/AU2019/tree/master/src/Dynamo_Packages) folder.  

Place the packages into this folder:  
%APPDATA%\Autodesk\C3D 2020\Dynamo\2.4\packages

Open Dynamo in AutoCAD Civil 3D 2020 to test the scripts.
